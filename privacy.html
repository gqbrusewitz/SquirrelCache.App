    <p><strong>Effective date:</strong> February 2026</p>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>SquirrelCache ("the App") is designed with your privacy in mind. This Privacy Policy explains what information the App collects, how it is used, and the choices you have regarding your data.</p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>SquirrelCache is built to store your content locally on your device. We aim to collect as little personal information as possible.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Content you save:</strong> Photos, links, notes, and other items you choose to cache within the App are stored on your device.</li>
      <li><strong>Usage analytics:</strong> We may collect anonymous, aggregated usage data (such as which features are used most frequently) to improve the App. This data cannot be used to identify you personally.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>Any information we collect is used solely to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Provide and maintain the App's functionality</li>
      <li>Improve and optimize the user experience</li>
      <li>Fix bugs and address technical issues</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Storage &amp; Security</h2>
    <p>Your cached content is stored locally on your device. We do not transmit your saved content to external servers unless a feature explicitly requires it (for example, syncing across devices), and you will always be informed before any such transfer occurs.</p>
    <p>We implement reasonable security measures to protect the data handled by the App, but no method of electronic storage is 100% secure.</p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>The App may integrate with third-party services (such as analytics providers or cloud storage). These services have their own privacy policies, and we encourage you to review them. We will never sell your personal data to third parties.</p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>SquirrelCache is not directed at children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you believe we have inadvertently collected data from a child, please contact us so we can delete it.</p>

    <h2>Your Rights</h2>
    <p>Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have the right to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Access the personal data we hold about you</li>
      <li>Request correction or deletion of your data</li>
      <li>Opt out of analytics data collection</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do, we will revise the "Effective date" at the top of this page. Continued use of the App after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.</p>

    <h2>Contact Us</h2>
    <p>If you have questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy, please reach out to us via our GitHub repository or the contact information provided in the App.</p>
